        "### Methods\n",
        "The process for building a DQN and optimizing it followed these basic steps:\n",
        "1. Build a working DQN, including helper functions needed to output Q-values (quality values).\n",
        "2. Identify key hyperparameters and run tests on these parameters to determine their effect on the model.\n",
        "3. Build and test a new model based on the highest-performing hyperparameters from step 2.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Building the DQN \n",
        "To build the DQN, several components are needed. It needs a neural network, a replay buffer, a greedy function, and a training function. \n",
        "\n",
        "The neural network for this problem was composed of the following layers:\n",
        "* An embedding layer with 16 input dimensions (to match the 4x4 grid)\n",
        "* A dense layer\n",
        "* An output layer, with 4 outputs (to match the 4 possible actions the agent may take)\n",
        "\n",
        "An embedding layer is useful for this problem, as it maps indices to dense vectors. It is an efficient way to encode inputs as one-hot vectors.\n",
        "\n",
        "This implementation uses a replay buffer (deque) to store the agent's experiences during training. For each training episode, the replay buffer is sampled at random so that the DQN training is not based only on the most recent experiences. This improves the quality of the training by reducing correlations in the training batch. \n",
        "\n",
        "When a new Frozen Lake environment is created, the untrained model is blind to the results of movement to any new space on the map. Therefore, it must incorporate a sort of exploration policy so that it may explore the map. Without this exploration, the agent may never find the reward and will get stuck as no moves provide any benefit. To accomplish this, an `epsilon greedy policy` is used. Epsilon is the probability that the agent will explore. In this implementation, during training, the value of epsilon is linearly decreased until a minimum value (0.01). In other words, after each episode, the agent has a lower chance of exploring new spaces. In theory, by the time epsilon reaches a minimum, the agent has located the reward and has positive reinforcement to visit that area again. When the agent does not explore new spaces, it makes a greedy choice based on predicted values, given its state. That is, at any given location on the map, the agent chooses the one with the highest hope of reward.\n",
        "\n",
        "With these components in place the following training algorithm was utilized (Géron, p. 636):\n",
        "1. Get a sample batch of experiences from the replay buffer.\n",
        "2. Predict the Q-values based on the state the sample experience left the agent in.\n",
        "3. Choose the best Q-values.\n",
        "4. Calculate the target Q-values. The target Q-value is the result of this equation: 𝑄<sub>target</sub>(𝑠, 𝑎) = 𝑟 + 𝛾 max 𝑄(𝑠′,𝑎′), where `r` is the rewards, `𝛾` is the discount factor, and `max 𝑄(𝑠′,𝑎′)` is the max Q-value from step 3.\n",
        "5. One-hot encode the actions to zero-out unwanted Q-values.\n",
        "6. Compute the loss and perform a gradient descent step to minimize the loss.\n",
        "\n",
        "The discount factor in step 4 is critical. When the agent reaches the reward, every step leading up to the reward is given a fraction of the reward. The further the location from the final reward, the smaller the reward received.\n",

        "### Discussion and Conclusion\n",
        "DQN was a successful deep-learning model for solving Frozen Lake. Adjusting the hyperparameters produced a fast learning model with an overall win ratio of 69% during training.  Of the hyperparameters tested, the most important were the learning rate and the optimizer. A learning rate of 0.001 produced a 27% improvement over 0.0001. However, this is not a direct improvement. Had the model trained on more iterations, the slower learning rate might have produced better results. This is because a slow learning rate takes many iterations to find the optimal solution, while a faster learning rate may find it quickly but is possibly less accurate.\n",
        "\n",
        "The Adam optimizer substantially outperformed the SGD optimizer. This is likely because it stores adaptive learning rates and requires less tuning than SGD. In this experiment, the parameters of the SGD optimizer were not tested or fine-tuned. It is possible that further testing will result in similar performance between Adam and SGD.\n",
        "\n",
        "This experiment involved manually picking hyperparameters and testing them individually, largely due to the computation time needed for testing. Future testing utilizing methods like grid search would allow for a more expansive look into how each hyperparameter affects the other. Additionally, testing each hyperparameter on larger datasets (n > 10,000) may reveal new patterns that were hidden by this experiment's small test sizes. Finally, the range of values for each hyperparameter tested was narrow in this test. Expanding these ranges may also further optimizations and additional patterns not seen here."
