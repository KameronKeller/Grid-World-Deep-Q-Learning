# Grid-World-Deep-Q-Learning
[Frozen Lake](https://gymnasium.farama.org/environments/toy_text/frozen_lake/) is a simple grid world where an agent must dodge holes in a frozen lake in order to reach a reward. A combination of Q-Learning and Deep Learning, Deep Q-Learning (DQN), was used to successfully train an agent to navigate the grid world to reach a reward. 
 
To determine the optimal hyperparameters for the machine learning model, research was conducted on the impacts of five different hyperparameters on the model's effectiveness. The most effective hyperparameters were then chosen and applied to a new model. Finally, the new model was tested to determine a final outcome.
